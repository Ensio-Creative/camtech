Vibration monitoring can be important in industrial applications such as Pumping and Compressor Systems for the purpose of preventive maintenance and diagnostics. CARMTEK Systems provide wireless connectivity to remote sites, to allow Remote Monitoring of Pump Compressor Operations.

##### Interface Vibration Sensors to PLC, RTU, Data Loggers, or Vibration Analysis Systems or Direct Sat1xx RTU
CARMTEK system can monitor Vibration Sensor directly from SAT XXX DEVICES, or RTU, or indirectly through PLC, RTU, Data Loggers, and Vibration Analysis Gateways. Vibration Sensors can be connected via I/O (4 - 20ma), RS232/RS485 Serial, Ethernet, or Wifi Connectivity to PLC, RTU, Data Logger, or specialized Vibration Analysis Systems.
