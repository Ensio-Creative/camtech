The CARMTEK PumpMate Control Systems is a modular self-contained Pump Control System that can be expanded from a one to 20 nodes. The PumpMate system consists of a single Master Pump Node Panel and 19 additional Pump/Meter Nodes Panels. 


A PumpMate Node consists of a PLC system with Touchscreen Interface with the License Free Wireless Communications designed and pre-configured for flexible modular control Pump Strings. The Pump system can be completely field configured via menus on the color touchscreen HMI. Once properly configured, the Pumping System can be controlled from the Pump Nodes.

Each PumpMate Node can be configured to connect to a VFD Driven Pump, or Diesel Engine Driven Pump, or used strictly as a Metering Node. Each Pump Node allows remote starting/stopping of Pump, ESD the Pump System, and Changing the Pump speeds; and Monitoring the Pump operations including Run Status, Inlet/Outlet Pressures, Outlet Temperature, Outlet Flow, and 3 Auxillary Flows and Levels. Each Pump can be interlocked to any Pump in the System.

License Free Wireless Communications Technology is used in the PumpMate system to connect the Remote PumpMate Nodes. The PumpMate System can be connected to WAN/Internet via SATXXX Gateway to allow SCADA or Third Party SCADA System Access to Monitor a complete PumpMate Network
